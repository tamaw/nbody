Compile with make

$ make

All dependancies are included under libs with the exception of MPI.

To run without a display and without MPI the first edit the header file and
set DISPLAY_ON to false and MPI_ON to false. Compile with 

$ make clean; make

then run with 

$./bin/nbody

You can adjust the number of bodies and the amount of time in the header 
file also.

To run with MPI set MPI_ON to true and make clean then make and run job.sh

Someone else is using the cluster at this time. Sunday afternoon.
The cluster goes faster however only at times. Seeing as the host computer 
doesn't actually do any processing for the cluster, it appears to get better
results.
