All dependancies are included under libs with the exception of MPI.

The output of the eight body run is located in the file eightoutput.txt.
That includes 8 bodies on one processor with 100 ticks

Pictures are in the screenshots/ folder with varius confiurations.

To run without a display and without MPI the first edit the header file
nbody.h and set DISPLAY_ON to false and MPI_ON to false. Compile with :

$ make clean; make

then run with :

$./bin/nbody

You can adjust the number of bodies and the amount of time in the header 
file also.

To run with MPI set MPI_ON in nbody.h to true then:

$ make clean; make;

and run

$job.sh 

or 

$ mpiexec -n 16 -hostfile hostfile ./bin/nbody

My results weren't as successful as the cluster was in use at the time.

Someone else is using the cluster at this time. Sunday afternoon / night.
The cluster goes faster however only at times. Seeing as the host computer 
doesn't actually do any processing for the cluster, it appears to get better
results. I can only conclude from my results that the parallel computing on negitivily reflects my results.
